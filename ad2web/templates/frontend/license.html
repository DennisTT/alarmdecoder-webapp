PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY

This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,
you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the
software.

The enclosed computer program(s) ("Software") is licensed, not sold, to you by
Nu Tech Software Solutions, Inc. ("Nu Tech Software Solutions") for use only
under the terms of this License, and Nu Tech Software Solutions reserves any
rights not expressly granted to you. You own the disk(s) on which the Software
is recorded or fixed, but Nu Tech Software Solutions, its licensors and
sub-licensors retain ownership of the Software itself.

1. Definitions

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction" and "distribution" have the same meaning
here as under U.S. copyright law. "You" means the licensee of the software.
"Your company" means the company you worked for when you downloaded the
software. "Reference use" means use of the software by you or within your
company as a reference, for the sole purposes of developing your product,
debugging your products, maintaining your products, or enhancing the
interoperability of your products with the software, and specifically excludes
the right to distribute the software outside of your company or to any third
party.

2. Grant of Rights

(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, the Licensor grants
you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
to reproduce the software for reference use.

3. Limitations

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you any rights to use the
Licensorâ€™s name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you begin patent litigation against the Licensor over patents that you
think may apply to the software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), your license to the software ends automatically.

(C) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. In no event
will Nu Tech Software Solutions, its parent or subsidiaries or any of the
licensors or sub-licensors, directors, officers, employees or affiliates of any
of the foregoing be liable to you for any consequential, incidental, indirect or
special damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of
business profits, business interruption, loss of business information and the
like), whether foreseeable or or unforeseeable, arising out of the use of or
inability to use the Software or accompanying written materials, regardless of
the basis of the claim and even if Nu Tech Software Solutions or a Nu Tech
Software Solutions representative has been advised of the possibility of such
damage. Nu Tech Software Solutions' liability to you for direct damages for any
cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, will be limited to
replacement of the Software that caused the damages. THE LIMITATION WILL NOT
APPLY IN CASE OF PERSONAL INJURY ONLY WHERE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE
LAW REQUIRES SUCH LIABILITY. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

4. General

(A) This License will be construed under the laws of the State of Oregon. If any
provision of this License shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be contrary to law, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible, and the remaining provisions of this License will remain in full
force and effect. If you are a U.S. Government user, then the Software is
provided with " RESTRICTED RIGHTS" as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2)
of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights clause at FAR 52.227-19 or
subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software
clause at DFARS 252.277-7013, as applicable. Manufacturer: Nu Tech Software
Solutions, 11575 SW Pacific HWY, Suite 109, Tigard, Oregon 97223

5. Termination

(A) This License is effective until terminated. This License will terminate
immediately without notice from Nu Tech Software Solutions or judicial
resolution if you fail to comply with any provision of this license. Upon such
termination you must destroy the Software, all accompanying written materials
and all copies thereof, and Sections 3, and 4 will survive any termination.
